<think>Based on the image, the central retinal artery occlusion is indicated by the presence of retinal whitening and a cherry-red spot. The whitening represents the ischemic retina, and the cherry-red spot is a sign of the ischemic retina due to the blockage of the central retinal artery. The likely causative clot is not visible in the image, but the presence of these signs suggests a central retinal artery occlusion.</think>
