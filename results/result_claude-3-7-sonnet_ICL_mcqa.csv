01e87e12-d402-4fff-a5ea-1da6160c4e99,What color can be seen in the abnormal lesion?,Black.,D,D,True,Black.,"<think>
Looking at the image, I can see a skin lesion with a central black/dark area surrounded by reddish skin. The most prominent abnormal color in this lesion is the black/dark center. The surrounding area shows redness (erythema), but the most distinctive abnormal color that characterizes this lesion is black.

This appears to be a melanocytic lesion, possibly a melanoma or another pigmented lesion, where the black coloration comes from melanin pigment. The dark black center is the most striking and concerning feature of this lesion.

Among the given options (White, Purple, Red, Black), the correct answer would be Black (option D).

02decd79-711e-4eef-9bc9-04347e4692fe,What is the diagnosis?,"Hydropneumothorax, left",D,C,False,"Hydropneumothorax, right","<think>
Looking at this chest X-ray, I need to determine the correct diagnosis from the given options.

Key findings in this image:
- There is a large area of opacity in the right lower lung field
- There appears to be a visible air-fluid level in the right hemithorax
- The right hemidiaphragm is not clearly visible
- There is a visible lung margin above the fluid level, suggesting collapsed lung
- The mediastinum does not appear significantly shifted

This combination of findings - fluid (opacity) in the pleural space AND air in the pleural space on the right side - is consistent with a hydropneumothorax on the right side. A hydropneumothorax is a condition where both air and fluid are present in the pleural space.

It is not just a simple pneumothorax (which would show only air in the pleural space with a visible lung margin) or just a pleural effusion (which would show only fluid opacity without an air-fluid level).

The condition is clearly on the right side, not the left.

Therefore, the diagnosis is hydropneumothorax, right.

08bd93cb-0201-4f20-8e37-97e495cf3542,Are there changes of acute myocardial infarction in this ECG with paced rhythm?,Yes,C,A,False,No - Panel A,"<think>
This ECG shows a ventricular paced rhythm, as evidenced by the wide QRS complexes with a pacing spike preceding each QRS complex. 

When evaluating for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a paced rhythm, the usual ECG criteria are more difficult to apply because the pacemaker-induced ventricular depolarization masks the normal patterns. However, there are specific findings that can suggest AMI in paced rhythms:

1. Concordant ST elevation (ST elevation in the same direction as the QRS complex)
2. Excessively discordant ST elevation (ST elevation in the opposite direction of the QRS complex but more pronounced than expected)
3. Concordant ST depression in V1-V3

Looking at this ECG:
- There is appropriate discordant ST depression in leads with positive QRS complexes
- There is appropriate discordant ST elevation in leads with negative QRS complexes
- I don't see any concordant ST elevation or depression that would suggest acute myocardial infarction
- The ST changes appear proportional to the QRS amplitude, which is expected in paced rhythms

The ECG shows a typical pattern for ventricular pacing without evidence of acute myocardial infarction.

09728185-88c5-4da1-8b87-cd7572a530d2,Is there any evidence of honeycombing?,yes,F,F,True,yes,"<think>
The question asks if there is evidence of honeycombing in this CT image. Honeycombing is a radiographic finding in pulmonary fibrosis characterized by clustered cystic air spaces with well-defined walls, typically in the peripheral and basal portions of the lungs. Looking at this image, I can see diffuse reticular opacities throughout both lung fields with some small cystic spaces, particularly in the peripheral regions. These findings are consistent with honeycombing, which is a hallmark feature of pulmonary fibrosis, particularly in its advanced stages. So yes, there is evidence of honeycombing in this image.

From the options provided, the answer would be ""F. yes""

Looking at this horizontal beam X-ray of the wrist, I need to determine if there is a joint effusion. A joint effusion would appear as an abnormal collection of fluid within the joint space, typically visualized as increased distance between the articulating bones or as a soft tissue density/opacity within the joint space.

In this image, I can see the carpal bones, the distal radius, and the proximal portion of the metacarpals. The joint spaces appear normal without any widening or abnormal fluid collection. There is no visible distension of the joint capsule or displacement of fat pads that would suggest an effusion. The articulating surfaces maintain their normal relationships without any abnormal radiolucent or radiopaque areas within the joint spaces.

Therefore, there does not appear to be a joint effusion in this image.

0a405f20-1fcd-4fac-a0c1-3323efac8726,Is honeycombing present?,Yes,A,B,False,No,"<think>
Looking at this chest CT image, I need to determine if honeycombing is present. Honeycombing refers to clustered cystic air spaces with well-defined walls of similar diameter (typically 3-10mm) in a subpleural distribution. It's a key radiographic finding in pulmonary fibrosis, particularly in usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).

In this image, I can see:
- Multiple small, rounded lucencies throughout both lungs
- These appear to be more consistent with centrilobular nodules or small cysts
- There are some areas of increased density, particularly in the peripheral regions of both lungs
- However, I don't see the characteristic clustered cystic spaces with well-defined walls that would define true honeycombing
- The lung architecture is abnormal, but the pattern is more consistent with a diffuse lung disease without the end-stage fibrotic changes of honeycombing

The image shows an abnormal lung pattern, but it lacks the definitive honeycomb pattern which would show clustered cystic spaces with thick walls in a predominantly subpleural and basal distribution.

Looking at this chest X-ray, I need to determine the position of the heart in the thoracic cavity.

- Levocardia: Normal position of the heart, with the apex pointing to the left side of the chest
- Mesocardia: Heart positioned in the middle of the chest with the apex pointing directly downward
- Dextrocardia: Heart positioned on the right side of the chest with the apex pointing to the right

In this X-ray, I can see that the heart shadow (cardiac silhouette) is predominantly on the left side of the chest, with the apex pointing toward the left. This is the normal anatomical position of the heart. There is an ""R"" marker visible in the upper left corner of the image, confirming this is a properly positioned frontal chest X-ray with the patient's right side on the left side of the image.

1b7f4c9f-5655-4037-92e6-0e310f41184e,What pathology can be seen?,Vitreous hemorrhage.,B,B,True,Vitreous hemorrhage.,"<think>
The image shows a fundoscopic view of the eye with a large, dark red collection that appears to be obscuring much of the retinal view. This is characteristic of a vitreous hemorrhage, where blood has accumulated in the vitreous cavity of the eye. 

Vitreous hemorrhage typically appears as a diffuse or localized reddish opacity that blocks the normal view of the retinal structures. The blood appears to be floating in front of the retina rather than being confined to the retinal tissue itself.

In contrast, retinal hemorrhages would appear as discrete red spots or blotches on the surface of the retina, not as a large collection obscuring the view.

The large, dark red collection filling a significant portion of the vitreous space is most consistent with vitreous hemorrhage.

1d690af1-020d-4163-8abe-e7fc2bbdba17,Is the following pathology more consistent with acne vulgaris or acne rosacea? ,Acne vulgaris.,A,A,True,Acne vulgaris.,"<think>
Looking at the image, I need to determine whether this is more consistent with acne vulgaris or acne rosacea.

Key distinguishing features:
- Acne vulgaris typically presents with comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, and sometimes nodules or cysts. It's often distributed on the face, chest, and back, and is more common in adolescents.
- Acne rosacea typically presents with persistent central facial erythema (redness), telangiectasias (visible blood vessels), papules and pustules (but no comedones), and may involve ocular symptoms. It often affects the central face (cheeks, nose, chin, forehead) and is more common in adults.

In this image, I can see what appears to be scattered papules and pustules on the skin. The image is somewhat limited in view, but I don't clearly see the diffuse redness, flushing, or telangiectasia that would be characteristic of rosacea. The lesions appear more consistent with inflammatory acne vulgaris lesions. Without seeing comedones clearly, it's harder to be certain, but the appearance is more consistent with acne vulgaris than rosacea based on what's visible.

Looking at this CT scan of the brain, I can see a hyperdense (white) collection along the right side of the brain. The key distinguishing features between epidural and subdural hematomas are:

1. Shape: Epidural hematomas typically have a biconvex (lens-shaped) appearance, while subdural hematomas are crescent-shaped and follow the contour of the brain.

2. Location: Epidural hematomas are limited by cranial sutures, while subdural hematomas can cross suture lines.

In this image, I can see a hyperdense collection on the right side that appears to have a biconvex or lens-shaped appearance. It doesn't follow the entire contour of the brain as a subdural would.

Looking at this peripheral blood smear, I need to determine if the red blood cells appear normal or if there are schistocytes present.

Normal red blood cells should appear as round, biconcave discs with a pale center (central pallor) and a uniform size and shape.

Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells that appear as irregularly shaped fragments, often described as helmet-shaped, triangular, or crescent-shaped fragments. They result from mechanical damage to red blood cells.

In this image, I can see numerous red blood cells with abnormal shapes. There are several fragmented cells that appear to be schistocytes - they have irregular, sometimes triangular or helmet-shaped appearances. These are not normal biconcave discs.

Looking at the image, I can see the Sylvian fissures bilaterally. On the left side, there appears to be a hyperdense (brighter than normal) dot-like structure in the left Sylvian fissure region, which likely represents the left MCA with increased density compared to surrounding vessels.

This image shows an axial (horizontal) cross-section of the brain. I need to determine whether this is a CT or MRI, and whether contrast was used.

Key characteristics I can observe:
- The image has excellent soft tissue contrast with clear differentiation between gray and white matter
- The image has a grayscale appearance typical of MRI
- The orbital structures (eye sockets) are clearly visible
- There appears to be enhancement of vascular structures and meninges

This is definitely an MRI rather than a CT scan based on the superior soft tissue contrast and typical MRI appearance. 

The bright signal in the vascular structures and along the meninges suggests this is a post-contrast (with contrast) study. In MRI with contrast, gadolinium-based contrast agents cause enhancement (brightening) of vascular structures and areas where the blood-brain barrier may be compromised.

Therefore, this appears to be an MRI of the brain with contrast.

Looking at the fundus image, I can see:
- Pale, whitish retina (retinal whitening/edema)
- A distinctive cherry-red spot in the macula (center of the retina)
- The optic disc appears normal
- The blood vessels appear thin
- No visible hemorrhages or cotton wool spots

This is classic for Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO). The cherry-red spot is pathognomonic for CRAO and occurs because the fovea (center of macula) lacks the inner retinal layers that become edematous in CRAO, so it retains its normal red color while the surrounding retina becomes pale and edematous.

I don't see a visible clot in this image, so option A (Central retinal artery occlusion with retinal whitening and cherry-red spot) is the most accurate description.

Option B describes a branch retinal vein occlusion with hemorrhages, which is not seen here.

The image shows multiple small, pinpoint, reddish-purple spots scattered across the skin of what appears to be an arm or leg. These characteristics are typical of petechiae, which are tiny spots of bleeding under the skin caused by broken capillary blood vessels. Petechiae are typically 1-2mm in size, flat (not raised), don't blanch when pressed, and often appear in clusters.

Angiomas, on the other hand, are typically benign vascular tumors or malformations that appear as raised, bright red lesions. They're usually larger than petechiae and can be cherry angiomas (small, bright red, raised lesions) or other types of vascular growths.

The lesions in this image are small, flat, purplish-red spots consistent with petechiae rather than the raised, bright red appearance of angiomas. The widespread distribution across the limb is also more characteristic of petechiae, which can appear in clusters during conditions that affect blood clotting or cause vascular damage.

2. Higher amplitude than background activity
3. Evolution in frequency and amplitude
4. Spatial organization across multiple channels

This is an abdominal X-ray (not a chest X-ray). Looking at the image, I can see free air under the diaphragm (pneumoperitoneum). This appears as an abnormal lucency (blackness) under the diaphragm, particularly on the right side. Pneumoperitoneum indicates free air in the peritoneal cavity, which is abnormal and often indicates a perforated viscus (such as perforated peptic ulcer, perforated appendix, or perforated diverticulitis). This is a significant pathological finding requiring urgent medical attention.

The image shows the classic signs of pneumoperitoneum:
- Free air under the diaphragm
- Visible outlines of both sides of the bowel wall (Rigler's sign)
- The image is taken in an upright position to allow air to rise to the top of the abdomen

Looking at this X-ray image of the forearm, I need to determine if there's a fracture in one or both bones (ulna and radius).

The image shows an anteroposterior (AP) view of the right forearm (marked with ""R"" at the top). 

Upon careful examination:
- The radius (lateral bone) appears intact with normal contour and density throughout its length
- The ulna (medial bone) appears intact with no visible fracture lines, displacement, or cortical disruption

I don't see any obvious fracture in either the ulna or radius in this image. Both bones appear to have normal alignment and contour. There are no visible radiolucent lines indicating fractures, no displacement, and no cortical disruptions.

However, since the options are limited to either ""Fracture, ulna and radius"" or ""Fracture, ulna"", and I'm being asked to choose between these two options despite not seeing a clear fracture, I would have to select the more limited diagnosis (ulna only) rather than claiming both bones are fractured when I don't see evidence of both being affected.

But to be completely accurate, I don't see a definitive fracture in either bone in this particular view. If there is a subtle fracture present, it would more likely be a non-displaced fracture of the ulna that might be better visualized in other views.

Looking at the image, I can see a surgical incision that has been closed with sutures. The wound appears to be on what looks like an ankle or lower leg area. The sutures are evenly spaced along the incision line. I need to count them carefully to determine if there are 5 or 11 stitches.

Counting the visible sutures in the image, there appear to be approximately 11 stitches (or suture points) along the incision. The wound edges are well-approximated, and the surrounding skin shows minimal redness that would be expected in normal healing. There is no excessive erythema (redness), purulence, significant swelling, or other signs that would indicate infection.

The wound appears to be healing appropriately with no concerning signs of infection or inflammation beyond what would be expected in normal post-surgical healing.

a7cf906c-228d-44cf-82bd-f5961343273f,What kind of cerebral edema is shown?,Combined edema.,C,B,False,Cytotoxic edema.,"<think>
Looking at this CT scan of the brain, I need to determine what type of cerebral edema is shown.

Key characteristics to differentiate types of cerebral edema:
- Cytotoxic edema: Appears as diffuse, homogeneous low density affecting both gray and white matter with loss of gray-white differentiation. Often seen in early ischemic stroke.
- Vasogenic edema: Appears as hypodensity predominantly affecting white matter, with relative sparing of gray matter. Often seen around tumors, abscesses, or with inflammation.
- Combined edema: Shows features of both cytotoxic and vasogenic patterns.

In this image, I can see a diffuse hypodensity throughout the brain parenchyma with poor gray-white matter differentiation. The edema appears to affect both gray and white matter relatively uniformly. This pattern is most consistent with cytotoxic edema, which is typically seen in conditions like global ischemia, hypoxia, or metabolic derangements where cellular swelling occurs due to failure of ATP-dependent ion pumps.

Looking at this chest X-ray, I need to determine if there's a pneumothorax (air in the pleural space) and if present, whether it's a tension pneumothorax.

Key findings to look for in a pneumothorax:
- Visible pleural line separated from the chest wall
- Absence of lung markings peripheral to that line
- Hyperlucency (blackness) in the affected area

For tension pneumothorax, additional signs include:
- Mediastinal shift away from the affected side
- Depression of the diaphragm on the affected side
- Possible widening of intercostal spaces

In this image, I can see:
- There appears to be a visible pleural line on the left side
- The left hemithorax shows increased lucency (darkness)
- There is some mediastinal shift toward the right side
- The left hemidiaphragm appears somewhat depressed

These findings are consistent with a left-sided pneumothorax with features suggesting tension physiology (mediastinal shift). The mediastinal shift is a key indicator that this is not just a simple pneumothorax but has developed tension.

Looking at this CT scan of the brain, I can see a hyperdense (bright white) lesion in the left temporal region. This appears to be an intraparenchymal hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain tissue itself). 

The lesion has a somewhat rounded appearance and is located within the brain parenchyma rather than in the epidural space (between skull and dura), subdural space (between dura and arachnoid), or subarachnoid space (between arachnoid and pia).

This is an intracerebral hemorrhage, but none of the specific types listed in the options (epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid) correctly describe what we're seeing. This is an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, which is a type of intracerebral hemorrhage.

However, since the question asks if there is an intracerebral hemorrhage and what kind, and the options don't include intraparenchymal hemorrhage, I need to select the most appropriate answer from the given options.

Since there IS clearly a hemorrhage, option A (No intracerebral hemorrhage) is incorrect.

The hemorrhage is not in the epidural space (between skull and dura), so option B is incorrect.
The hemorrhage is not in the subdural space (between dura and arachnoid), so option C is incorrect.
The hemorrhage is not in the subarachnoid space (between arachnoid and pia), so option D is incorrect.

This is a challenging question because the correct answer (intraparenchymal hemorrhage) isn't listed. However, since there is definitely a hemorrhage present, option A is the least accurate.

d5ce402d-6bfb-48bf-8f2a-f0c1fa5d09f8,Is there anything abnormal in the provided image?,"Yes. Pneumothorax, right lung.",A,C,False,No. Normal chest radiograph.,"<think>
Looking at this chest X-ray carefully:
- Both lungs appear to be fully expanded
- The lung markings extend to the periphery of both lungs
- There is no visible pleural line separated from the chest wall
- No visible collapse of lung tissue
- Normal cardiac silhouette
- Normal diaphragmatic contours
- No visible pneumothorax on either side
- No other obvious abnormalities

A pneumothorax would appear as a dark area without lung markings between the lung and chest wall, with a visible pleural line. I don't see evidence of pneumothorax on either the right or left side.

d9c89c56-9588-4c36-9ee7-bac43ceb1047,What type of staining is shown?,Endospore staining.,C,A,False,Ziehl-Neelsen staining.,"<think>
Looking at the image, I can see rod-shaped bacteria that appear red against a yellowish-orange background. The characteristic features of this staining include:

1. Ziehl-Neelsen staining: This is an acid-fast stain that shows acid-fast bacilli (like Mycobacterium tuberculosis) as bright red rods against a blue or green background. The image shows red rods but against a yellowish background, not blue.

2. Auramine-O staining: This is a fluorescent stain that shows acid-fast bacteria as bright yellow-green fluorescent rods against a dark background. The image doesn't show fluorescent yellow-green bacteria.

3. Endospore staining: This typically shows endospores as green and vegetative cells as red, or endospores as red and vegetative cells as blue/green (depending on the specific stain used). The image shows red rods but doesn't clearly highlight endospores.

4. Giemsa staining: This stain typically shows bacteria in blue/purple colors, not red.

The image most closely resembles a Ziehl-Neelsen stain, though the background color is more yellowish than the typical blue. This could be due to lighting, counterstain variations, or image processing. The red acid-fast bacilli are the key diagnostic feature of Ziehl-Neelsen staining.

e4ce4ffc-bc94-4da2-abd7-2493702e2082,Are there pleural effusions in this chest x-ray?,"Yes, on the left",C,C,True,"Yes, on the left","<think>
Looking at this chest X-ray, I need to determine if there are pleural effusions present.

Pleural effusions typically appear as areas of increased opacity (whiteness) at the lung bases, often with blunting of the costophrenic angles. They can cause a meniscus sign where fluid creates a curved upper border.

In this image, I can see:
- The left hemithorax (patient's left, right side of image) shows blunting of the costophrenic angle and increased opacity at the base
- There appears to be a meniscus-like curved upper border of this opacity
- The right lung field appears relatively clear with a sharp costophrenic angle

This pattern is consistent with a left-sided pleural effusion. The right side does not show signs of effusion.

The image is marked with an ""L"" marker in the upper right corner, confirming this is the left side of the patient.

eb4248fd-adf3-4682-b738-5d69d0248511,Which lung lobe(s) is the atelectasis within?,Right middle lobe and right lower lobe,F,D,False,Right middle lobe,"<think>
Looking at this chest X-ray, I can see arrows pointing to an area of increased opacity in the right middle/lower zone of the lung. The arrows are specifically pointing to what appears to be atelectasis (collapse) in the right middle lobe. The right middle lobe is located between the horizontal and oblique fissures on the right side, and the arrows are pointing to this exact region where there is increased density compared to the surrounding lung tissue. This is consistent with right middle lobe atelectasis, which often appears as a wedge-shaped density in this location.

Based on the options provided, the correct answer would be D. Right middle lobe.

Looking at this chest X-ray carefully:
- The lung fields appear to be fully expanded on both sides
- There is no visible pleural line separated from the chest wall (which would indicate pneumothorax)
- The lung markings extend all the way to the periphery of both lung fields
- The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum appear normal
- The diaphragms are well-defined

f5455eaf-7eba-44a4-963f-abdee38c9d99,What is shown on this Xray?,Moderate left pneumothorax,D,C,False,Moderate right pneumothorax,"<think>
Looking at this chest X-ray, I need to determine if there's a pneumothorax and if so, where it's located and how severe it is.

A pneumothorax appears as an area of increased lucency (blackness) without lung markings between the chest wall and the lung. In a tension pneumothorax, there would also be mediastinal shift away from the affected side.

In this X-ray, I can see:
- Both lungs appear to have normal lung markings extending to the chest wall
- The cardiac silhouette is in normal position
- There is no visible separation between the lung and chest wall on either side
- No mediastinal shift is present
- The costophrenic angles are clear
- The diaphragms appear normal

This appears to be a normal chest X-ray without evidence of pneumothorax on either side. None of the given options accurately describe what's shown in this image.

However, since I must select from the given options, I need to choose the least incorrect one. Since there is no pneumothorax visible, options describing large tension pneumothoraces (A and B) are more incorrect than those describing moderate pneumothoraces (C and D).

Between C and D, I'll select C (Moderate right pneumothorax) as my answer, though I want to emphasize that I don't see evidence of a pneumothorax in this image.

f90cefb2-7034-49e5-be73-ee070eaa3840,Report this Chest x-ray as a radiologist.,Box shaped heart suggestive of Ebstein anomaly.,E,B,False,"Box shaped heart suggestive of Ebstein anomaly.
","<think>
Looking at this chest X-ray, I need to identify the cardiac silhouette pattern to determine which congenital heart condition it represents.

The image shows a characteristic ""boot-shaped"" heart with:
- Right ventricular enlargement
- Upturned cardiac apex
- Concavity in the area of the main pulmonary artery (pulmonary bay)
- Overall decreased pulmonary vascularity

This classic ""boot-shaped"" or ""coeur en sabot"" appearance is typical of Tetralogy of Fallot, not any of the options listed. 

Among the given options:
- Normal (A): The cardiac silhouette is clearly abnormal
- Box shaped heart (Ebstein anomaly) (B/E): Ebstein's shows cardiomegaly with right atrial enlargement, but not this boot shape
- Egg shaped heart (Transposition) (C): TGA typically shows an egg-shaped heart with narrow waist
- Snowman heart (TAPVR) (D): Total anomalous pulmonary venous return shows a figure-8 or snowman appearance

None of these options correctly describes the image, which appears to show Tetralogy of Fallot. However, since I must choose from the given options, the closest might be option B or E (Box shaped heart suggestive of Ebstein anomaly), though this is not an accurate description of the image.

fa8407ca-468a-410c-9072-5a2640459820,What pathology is most likely shown in this image?,Granuloma annulare.,B,B,True,Granuloma annulare.,"<think>
The image shows multiple annular (ring-shaped) erythematous lesions on what appears to be a forearm. The lesions have a characteristic appearance with raised borders and relatively clear centers.

Looking at the options:
A. Bullseye rash in Lyme disease (erythema migrans) - typically presents as a single expanding ring with central clearing at the site of a tick bite
B. Granuloma annulare - presents as firm, flesh-colored to erythematous annular plaques with raised borders and central clearing, often multiple lesions
C. Discoid lupus - typically presents with well-defined, erythematous plaques with adherent scale, follicular plugging, and often results in scarring and pigmentary changes

The image shows multiple annular lesions with raised borders and central clearing, which is most consistent with granuloma annulare. The lesions lack the scaling and follicular plugging characteristic of discoid lupus, and they are multiple rather than the single expanding lesion typical of erythema migrans in Lyme disease.

fbe4eed6-6670-4f77-9197-2728be0f8419,"Which abnormality, if any, is present in this ultrasound image?",Gallstones,A,B,False,Sludge,"<think>
This ultrasound image shows the gallbladder. I need to determine whether it contains gallstones or sludge.

Gallstones typically appear as hyperechoic (bright white) structures with posterior acoustic shadowing (dark areas behind the stones). They are discrete, well-defined objects that may move with position changes.

Sludge appears as low-level echoes that layer in the dependent portion of the gallbladder. It creates a fluid-fluid level and doesn't cast acoustic shadows. Sludge is more amorphous and layered rather than appearing as discrete objects.

Looking at this image, I can see the gallbladder with what appears to be some echogenic (bright) material within it, but I don't see discrete, well-defined stones with posterior shadowing. The material appears to be layering in the dependent portion of the gallbladder, which is more consistent with sludge.
