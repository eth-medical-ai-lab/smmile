2. **Infection**: Certain infections, such as bacterial or viral enterocolitis, can cause similar appearances.
3. **Cancer**: While less common, certain types of colorectal cancer can present with similar findings.

3. **Cancer**: While less common, certain types of colorectal cancer can present with similar findings.
4. **Diverticulitis**: Inflammation of diverticula (small pouches) in the colon wall can sometimes lead to similar appearances.

For an accurate diagnosis, a thorough medical history, physical examination, and possibly further tests such as biopsies, endoscopic ultrasound, or imaging studies would be necessary. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis."
