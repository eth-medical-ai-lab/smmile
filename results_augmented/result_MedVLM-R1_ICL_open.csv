Granuloma annulare.

Granuloma annulare is a skin condition characterized by small, round, red, and raised lesions that are often found on the hands, feet, or face. The lesions are usually painless and do not cause any discomfort. The condition is typically caused by an infection with a type of fungus called Candida albicans. The lesions can be itchy and may be accompanied by a burning sensation. Granuloma annulare is not contagious and does not spread to other parts of the body. It is important to seek medical attention if the lesions become infected or if they cause discomfort.","The pathology most likely shown in this image is:
